// Player presses button on page to start quiz
    // Timer displays and starts ticking down
    // First Question Displayed

// If A player gets a question correct then the quiz advances to the next question and "Correct" is briefly displayed under the quiz

// If A player gets a question wrong then the quiz still advances to the next question but "Wrong" is briefly displayed at the bottom and the timer loses an additional 5sec (maybe have correct/wrong section have a green vs red background based on result)

// Upon answering all questions or running out of time they will see their final score and have a chance to submit their initials. (Hitting submit automatically takes them to the high scores page.)





// Class Demo
// score is time remaining?
// separate js file for game and highscores page
// separate html page for high scores and index
// Don't have to name index.html when linking from high scores back to index, can just href="./"


// Declare timer/score variable (number)

// Declare "questions" (array of questoins)

// Each question/answer/correct answer combo will be an object (all question objects should share identical property names)

// var question = [
//     {
//         question object
//             // question
//             // answers
//             // correct answer
//     }
//     {
//         question object
//     }
// ]

// variables for page objects ( start button, timer number, main quiz area "any area of the page we need to modify with javascript")

// "timeEl" good naming idea to add El to variables that are referencing html elements

// Function for "startGame"
    // Hide the start screen

    // Display the first question

    // Set starting value of countdown

    // Start timer (maybe separate function that's called by startGame function)

// Function "answerQuestion"
    // Check if selected answer is correct
        // If the answer is wrong
            // Then we need to subtract from timer
    // Display next question

// Function "diplayCurrentQuestion"




// change id tag on quiz section to change it to a style where it's hidden


// for collecting high score refer to day 2 activity 13 for similar example to collect and put into variable
    // input item, and submit button



// event.target ? for info on button clicked

// custom data attached to items (data-answer on buttons to store the contents of button?)
